<div class="textblock"><p>This is the Arduino <a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html" title="Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.">AccelStepper</a> library. It provides an object-oriented interface for 2, 3 or 4 pin stepper motors.</p>
<p>The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper">http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper</a>) for stepper motors. It is perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html" title="Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.">AccelStepper</a> significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Supports acceleration and deceleration </li>
<li>Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper </li>
<li>API functions never delay() or block </li>
<li>Supports 2, 3 and 4 wire steppers, plus 3 and 4 wire half steppers. </li>
<li>Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library</a>) </li>
<li>Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun EasyDriver (based on 3967 driver chip) </li>
<li>Very slow speeds are supported </li>
<li>Extensive API </li>
<li>Subclass support</li>
</ul>

<p>Tested on Arduino Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0018 &amp; arduino-0021 on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15, cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Installation</dt><dd>Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries sub-folder of your sketchbook.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Theory</dt><dd>This code uses speed calculations as described in "Generate stepper-motor speed profiles in real time" by David Austin <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf">http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf</a> with the exception that <a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html" title="Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.">AccelStepper</a> uses steps per second rather than radians per second (because we dont know the step angle of the motor) An initial step interval is calculated for the first step, based on the desired acceleration On subsequent steps, shorter step intervals are calculated based on the previous step until max speed is achieved.</dd></dl>

<dl class="section user"><dt>Revision History</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<dl class="section version"><dt>Version</dt><dd>1.0 Initial release</dd>
<dd>
1.1 Added speed() function to get the current speed. </dd>
<dd>
1.2 Added runSpeedToPosition() submitted by Gunnar Arndt. </dd>
<dd>
1.3 Added support for stepper drivers (ie with Step and Direction inputs) with _pins == 1 </dd>
<dd>
1.4 Added functional contructor to support AFMotor, contributed by Limor, with example sketches. </dd>
<dd>
1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Use of microsecond steps and other speed improvements to increase max stepping speed to about 4kHz. New option for user to set the min allowed pulse width. Added checks for already running at max speed and skip further calcs if so. </dd>
<dd>
1.6 Fixed a problem with wrapping of microsecond stepping that could cause stepping to hang. Reported by Sandy Noble. Removed redundant _lastRunTime member. </dd>
<dd>
1.7 Fixed a bug where setCurrentPosition() did not always work as expected. Reported by Peter Linhart. </dd>
<dd>
1.8 Added support for 4 pin half-steppers, requested by Harvey Moon </dd>
<dd>
1.9 setCurrentPosition() now also sets motor speed to 0. </dd>
<dd>
1.10 Builds on Arduino 1.0 </dd>
<dd>
1.11 Improvments from Michael Ellison: Added optional enable line support for stepper drivers Added inversion for step/direction/enable lines for stepper drivers </dd>
<dd>
1.12 Announce Google Group </dd>
<dd>
1.13 Improvements to speed calculation. Cost of calculation is now less in the worst case, and more or less constant in all cases. This should result in slightly beter high speed performance, and reduce anomalous speed glitches when other steppers are accelerating. However, its hard to see how to replace the sqrt() required at the very first step from 0 speed. </dd>
<dd>
1.14 Fixed a problem with compiling under arduino 0021 reported by EmbeddedMan </dd>
<dd>
1.15 Fixed a problem with runSpeedToPosition which did not correctly handle running backwards to a smaller target position. Added examples </dd>
<dd>
1.16 Fixed some cases in the code where abs() was used instead of fabs(). </dd>
<dd>
1.17 Added example ProportionalControl </dd>
<dd>
1.18 Fixed a problem: If one calls the funcion runSpeed() when Speed is zero, it makes steps without counting. reported by Friedrich, Klappenbach. </dd>
<dd>
1.19 Added MotorInterfaceType and symbolic names for the number of pins to use for the motor interface. Updated examples to suit. Replaced individual pin assignment variables _pin1, _pin2 etc with array _pin[4]. _pins member changed to _interface. Added _pinInverted array to simplify pin inversion operations. Added new function setOutputPins() which sets the motor output pins. It can be overridden in order to provide, say, serial output instead of parallel output Some refactoring and code size reduction. </dd>
<dd>
1.20 Improved documentation and examples to show need for correctly specifying <a class="el" href="classAccelStepper.html#a73bdecf1273d98d8c5fbcb764cabeea5adedd394a375190a3df8d4519c0d4dc2f" title="4 wire full stepper, 4 motor pins required">AccelStepper::FULL4WIRE</a> and friends. </dd>
<dd>
1.21 Fixed a problem where desiredSpeed could compute the wrong step acceleration when _speed was small but non-zero. Reported by Brian Schmalz. Precompute sqrt_twoa to improve performance and max possible stepping speed </dd>
<dd>
1.22 Added Bounce.pde example Fixed a problem where calling moveTo(), setMaxSpeed(), setAcceleration() more frequently than the step time, even with the same values, would interfere with speed calcs. Now a new speed is computed only if there was a change in the set value. Reported by Brian Schmalz. </dd>
<dd>
1.23 Rewrite of the speed algorithms in line with <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf">http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf</a> Now expect smoother and more linear accelerations and decelerations. The desiredSpeed() function was removed. </dd>
<dd>
1.24 Fixed a problem introduced in 1.23: with runToPosition, which did never returned </dd>
<dd>
1.25 Now ignore attempts to set acceleration to 0.0 </dd>
<dd>
1.26 Fixed a problem where certina combinations of speed and accelration could cause oscillation about the target position. </dd>
<dd>
1.27 Added stop() function to stop as fast as possible with current acceleration parameters. Also added new Quickstop example showing its use. </dd>
<dd>
1.28 Fixed another problem where certain combinations of speed and accelration could cause oscillation about the target position. Added support for 3 wire full and half steppers such as Hard Disk Drive spindle. Contributed by Yuri Ivatchkovitch. </dd>
<dd>
1.29 Fixed a problem that could cause a DRIVER stepper to continually step with some sketches. Reported by Vadim. </dd>
<dd>
1.30 Fixed a problem that could cause stepper to back up a few steps at the end of accelerated travel with certain speeds. Reported and patched by jolo. </dd>
<dd>
1.31 Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com </dd>
<dd>
1.32 Fixed a problem with enableOutputs() and setEnablePin on Arduino Due that prevented the enable pin changing stae correctly. Reported by Duane Bishop. </dd>
<dd>
1.33 Fixed an error in example AFMotor_ConstantSpeed.pde did not setMaxSpeed(); Fixed a problem that caused incorrect pin sequencing of FULL3WIRE and HALF3WIRE. Unfortunately this meant changing the signature for all step*() functions. Added example MotorShield, showing how to use AdaFruit Motor Shield to control a 3 phase motor such as a HDD spindle motor (and without using the AFMotor library. </dd>
<dd>
1.34 Added setPinsInverted(bool pin1Invert, bool pin2Invert, bool pin3Invert, bool pin4Invert, bool enableInvert) to allow inversion of 2, 3 and 4 wire stepper pins. Requested by Oleg. </dd>
<dd>
1.35 Removed default args from setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool, bool, bool) to prevent ambiguity with setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool). Reported by Mac Mac. </dd>
<dd>
1.36 Changed enableOutputs() and disableOutputs() to be virtual so can be overridden. Added new optional argument 'enable' to constructor, which allows you toi disable the automatic enabling of outputs at construction time. Suggested by Guido. </dd>
<dd>
1.37 Fixed a problem with step1 that could cause a rogue step in the wrong direction (or not, depending on the setup-time requirements of the connected hardware). Reported by Mark Tillotson. </dd>
<dd>
1.38 run() function incorrectly always returned true. Updated function and doc so it returns true if the motor is still running to the target position. </dd>
<dd>
1.39 Updated typos in keywords.txt, courtesey Jon Magill.</dd></dl>
